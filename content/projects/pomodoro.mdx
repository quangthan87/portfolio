<Paragraph>
  Pomodoro App is a mini web application which helps people boost their
  productivity by setting timer for focus and break intervals. This project is
  inspired by a{" "}

  created by Frontend Mentor. I implemented the design's core layout and color
  themes, and added some more user settings and also app sound.

<MajorHeading>Project Purpose and Goal</MajorHeading>

<Paragraph>
  The main purpose of this project was to practicing and improving my React and
  CSS skill. After many tutorials and courses, doing a project from scratch in
  unguided way is a good practice to solidify what I've learned.

<MajorHeading>Lessons Learned</MajorHeading>

<Paragraph>
  Even it's a very small app, I learned a lot about hooks and state management
  in React. During earlier implementation I used useState for every state logic
  in the root component hence made the codebase quite messy. Then I replaced
  useState with useReducer when the state logic got more complex and when
  setting a state depends on the current value of another state. That made the
  state management more clean and easier to maintain. I also practiced a lot of
  CSS knowledge when trying to translate the design into code.
