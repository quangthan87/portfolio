<Paragraph>
  This is a React-based classic snake game created for fun and for practicing my
  React skill. Creating this small game application was a perfect way for me to
  improve my understanding of the fundamentals of React and have fun with this
  UI library.

  I came across a{" "}

    video
  </ExternalLink>{" "}
  by Dan Abramov streaming his coding of a Snake game in plain Javascript. This
  is my favourite childhood game, so I decided take it as an inspiration and
  challenged myself to clone that game using React. It was also one of my first
  unguided React project after hours of online courses and tutorials.

<MajorHeading>Lessons Learned</MajorHeading>

<Paragraph>
  React might be overkill for this kind of mini game application compared to the
  vanilla solution, but I still learned a lot throughout the process of making
  this game. I improved my understanding of lifecycle of a React component and
  how to optimize a React application. At my first try the snake didn't move as
  fast as the setting interval due to my bad code structuring, however after
  some refactoring and adding memoization the application worked as expected.
  Working with custom React hooks also helped me understand more about the
  declarative concept of React, like Dan had explained in his blog post about{" "}
