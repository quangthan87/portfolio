<Paragraph>
  This is the website of administration dashboard for UEH dormitories. I built
  this project using{" "}
  <ExternalLink href="https://github.com/pratikborsadiya/vali-admin">
    Vali Admin
  </ExternalLink>{" "}
  for frontend part. This dashboard application required a fair amount of
  RESTful APIs and role-based authentication.

<MajorHeading>Project Purpose and Goal</MajorHeading>

<Paragraph>
  This website should serve as a management dashboard for 3 branches of UEH
  dormitory. UEH students can use the website to register for accommodation in
  the dormitory. After becoming resident of a dormitory, students can send their
  requests to the admin officers through this website. The UEH dormitory
  administrators can use the dashboard to manage all the activities inside the
  dormitories.

<MajorHeading>Lessons Learned</MajorHeading>

<Paragraph>
  There were many things that I learned from this project, but the most
  important parts might be the RESTful APIs and CRUD. I learned how to protect
  APIs with validation, authorization and role-based authentication. I also
  improved my understanding of MVC pattern.
