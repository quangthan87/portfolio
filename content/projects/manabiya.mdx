<Paragraph>
  Manabiya Japan is a startup agency in human resource area. This is a
  multi-lingual website created using Next.js with a bit utilization of Jamstack
  for dynamic contents. I used a{" "}

    template
  </ExternalLink>{" "}
  by Creative Tim to facilitate the design task and to boost the production
  time.

<MajorHeading>Project Purpose and Goal</MajorHeading>

<Paragraph>
  This website is the place where the agency can introduce their business and
  services to new customers. It also serves as a simple recruitment agency
  platform with registration forms where the employers can apply requirements
  for suitable candidates, and the employees can look for opportunities to find
  their dream jobs.

<MajorHeading>Lessons Learned</MajorHeading>

<Paragraph>
  As I used a template to build this website, the first important thing is to
  select the right component according to the content. As a result I learned how
  to use a UI library like Material UI more efficiently by reading their
  documentation and use cases. This also gave me a good exercise working with
  forms in React. Besides that, connecting a web application to a headless CMS
  was a difficult part as I was new to Jamstack. And last but not least, I
  improved my time management skill as this was one of my first freelance
  projects.
